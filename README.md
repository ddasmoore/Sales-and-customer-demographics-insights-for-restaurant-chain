  ## Recommendations 
  Based on the findings above, the following were recommended to the marketing team:
  1. Increase or continue marketing efforts for restaurant 3 as it had a lead in key revenue metrics. For restaurants 2 and 4 specifically, consider surveying customers to identify any painpoints related to ordering or menu items.
  2. Capitalize on Tues-Thurs by introducing specials, promotions or cross-sell items.
  3. Identify reasons for long delivery duration and mitigate those to increase customer satisfaction.
  4. Consider targeting customers who are in age group 22-40, $112K+, have kids with promotions that encourage continued loyalty since these are repeat customers. The top 20 customers (ages 20-31, with kids and yearly income over $105k) are an emerging segment to pay attention to. Consider promoting spefically to this group to increase AOV and ARPU.
